# Dc-Reflector 0.1

Dc-Reflector is a Python program to forward/copy messages of a channel to another channel. It doesn't handle deleted messages. That means Dc-Reflector will create replicate/archived version of the desired channel dynamically.

# How It Works?

Simply using your Discord account to log-in and listen for new messages on the tracked channel.
